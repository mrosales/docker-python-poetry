1. Dockerfiles must pass the [Hadolint](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint) linter.
   You should use the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook to ensure that any commits
   have valid Dockerfiles.
2. Each directory is built with [DockerHub Autobuild](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/).
